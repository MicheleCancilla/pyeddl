from pyeddl.layers.base import Layer


class Dense(Layer):
    """Just your regular densely-connected NN layer.

    `Dense` implements the operation:
    `output = activation(dot(input, kernel) + bias)`
    where `activation` is the element-wise activation function
    passed as the `activation` argument, `kernel` is a weights matrix
    created by the layer, and `bias` is a bias vector created by the layer
    (only applicable if `use_bias` is `True`).
    Note: if the input to the layer has a rank greater than 2, then
    it is flattened prior to the initial dot product with `kernel`.

    Example:
        # as first layer in a sequential model:
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(Dense(32, input_shape=(16,)))
        # now the model will take as input arrays of shape (*, 16)
        # and output arrays of shape (*, 32)
        # after the first layer, you don't need to specify
        # the size of the input anymore:
        model.add(Dense(32))

    Args:
        units: Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.
        activation: Activation function to use
            If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
            (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
        kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix
        bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector
        kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
        bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector
        activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the output of the layer (its "activation").
        kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
        bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector

    Input shape:
        nD tensor with shape: `(batch_size, ..., input_dim)`.
        The most common situation would be
        a 2D input with shape `(batch_size, input_dim)`.

    Output shape:
        nD tensor with shape: `(batch_size, ..., units)`.
        For instance, for a 2D input with shape `(batch_size, input_dim)`,
        the output would have shape `(batch_size, units)`.
